    * Comments from Dan, regarding flight to UFL:

>As I have told you earlier, the best airport to fly to is GNV, which is a 20-25 minute Uber ride away from campus. Delta flies here via ATL and American flies here via CLT.
>Jacksonville (JAX) is about 90 minutes away on a good day. If you take this route, DO NOT SPEED THROUGH STARKE, LAWTEY OR WALDO, or the cops will strip and tan your hide.
>Orlando (MCO) is 2 hours away on a good day, but I have had to sit in traffic for up to 4 hours when it was raining... I wouldn't recommend risking it if you're on a tight schedule.
